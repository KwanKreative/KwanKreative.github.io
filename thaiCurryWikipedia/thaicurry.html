                Thai curry (Thai: แกง, romanized: kaeng, pronounced [kɛ̄ːŋ]) is a dish in Thai cuisine made from curry paste, coconut milk or water, meat, seafood, vegetables or fruit, and herbs. Curries in Thailand mainly differ from the curries in India in their use of ingredients such as herbs and aromatic leaves over a mix of spices.[1][not specific enough to verify]

                The first Thai dictionary from 1873 CE (2416 in the Thai Buddhist calendar) defines kaeng as a watery dish to be eaten with rice and utilizing shrimp paste, onions or shallots, chillies, and garlic as essential ingredients.[2] Coconut milk is not included in this definition and many Thai curries, such as kaeng som and kaeng pa, do not feature it. Curries in Lanna (northern Thai) cuisine, with only a few exceptions, do not use coconut milk due to coconut palms not growing well, if at all, in the climate of the Thai highlands. The spiciness of Thai curries depends on the amount and kind of chilli used in the making of the paste. Even within one type of curry the spiciness can differ widely.

                The word "curry" figures in the Thai language as "kari" (Thai: กะหรี่), and refers to dishes using either an Indian-style curry powder, known as phong kari in Thailand, or to the dish called kaeng kari, an Indian-influenced curry that is made with spices that are common to Indian dishes but less often used in these proportions in Thai cuisine. Kung phat phong kari (prawns fried with egg and curry powder) is an example of a dish using the Indian style curry powder.[3]

                Although "kaeng" is also defined as being of "watery" substance, the thickness of the sauce can vary considerably from broth-like to that of a thick stew, and it can even be a completely dry dish. Representatives of dry curries, dishes which are (stir-)fried with a curry paste, are phat phrik khing and khua kling.[4][5] Kaeng som and keang pa are representatives of the more broth-like curries. Matsaman and kaeng khua[6] resemble stews. Ho mok pla (a steamed fish curry), kaeng kradang[7] (curry aspic from northern Thailand) and noodle dishes such as khanom chin nam ngiao[8] are also seen as Thai curry dishes as they all use curry pastes in their preparation.

            <p>
                The dish called kaeng chuet is an exception to the rule that a kaeng should contain chillies, garlic, onions and shrimp paste. It is a clear Chinese style meat and/or vegetable broth with mixed vegetables and often also minced pork, tofu and glass noodles. The name translates as "bland curry" but it is seen as being a tom, a soup, and it is therefore also often called tom chuet.[2]

Curries are eaten in combination with rice, the long-grained jasmine rice in central and southern Thailand and sticky rice in northern and northeastern Thailand, and with noodles such as khanom chin (fermented rice noodles). Certain curries can also be eaten with roti, the Thai version of the Indian-style fried flat bread from Malaysia called roti canai.

                Khao kaeng or khao rat kaeng, meaning "curry-on-rice", is a traditional type of fast food restaurant in Thailand which specialises in ready-made curries, and often several other dishes as well, served with rice. Their popularity in Bangkok as a place for a quick lunchtime meal is in decline.[9]

        <h2>Typical ingredients</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2><strong>Curry paste</h2></strong>
        <div>Thai curries are always made with a curry paste. Common ingredients used in many Thai curry pastes are:</div>
        <div id="list">
            <ul> 
                <li>Shrimp paste</li>
                <li>Chillies; depending on the curry these can be dried or fresh, red or green</li>
                <li>Onions or shallots</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Lemongrass</li>
                <li>Galangal</li>
                <li>Coriander (cilantro) root</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <p>
                Depending on the type of curry, additional ingredients for the paste can include spices such as turmeric, pepper, coriander seeds, cardamom pods, and cumin, or other ingredients such as boiled fermented fish,[10] and fingerroot. Ingredients are traditionally ground together with a mortar and pestle, though increasingly with an electric food processor. With many curries, the paste is first stir-fried in cooking oil before other components are added in to the dish. This allows certain flavours in the spices and other ingredients in the paste to develop that cannot be released at the lower temperature of boiling water.[11]

                Both khrueang kaeng (lit. 'kaeng ingredients') and nam phrik kaeng (lit. 'kaeng chilli paste') are used to describe "curry paste" in Thailand. The latter is sometimes even shortened to only phrik kaeng (lit. 'kaeng chilli').
                
                Thai curry pastes can be made at home from the bare ingredients, bought freshly made at markets in Thailand, or they can be had packaged at shops and supermarkets.[12]
